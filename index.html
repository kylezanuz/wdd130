        <p>Hi! My name is Kyle Danielle Santiago, and I’m from the Philippines. I’m currently a student at BYU–Idaho,
            enrolled in the Software Development program.
            I’ve been happily married for almost three years, and my spouse and I are thrilled to
            be expecting our first baby soon!

            I’m passionate about technology, creativity, and continuous learning. Through my studies, I hope to
            learn more about
            development skills and create meaningful projects that can help and inspire others.</p>
