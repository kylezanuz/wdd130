        <p>Hi! My name is Kyle Danielle Santiago, and I’m from the Philippines. I’m currently a student at BYU–Idaho,
            enrolled in
            the Software Development program. I’ve been happily married for almost three years, and my spouse and I are
            thrilled to
            be expecting our first baby soon! It’s both exciting and a little scary, but it’s a chapter I’m deeply
            grateful for.</p>

        <p>I’ve always been passionate about technology, creativity, and continuous learning. Through my studies, I hope
            to sharpen
            my development skills and create meaningful projects that can help and inspire others.</p>

        <p>Outside of school, I love watching movies — Harry Potter has always been my favorite — and lately, I’ve been
            really into
            anime. I’m also the eldest of six, which taught me early on about responsibility, patience, and caring for
            others. It’s
            a big part of who I am and why I always try to lead with empathy and purpose in everything I do.</p>

        <p>Luneta Shrine in the Philippines, also known as Rizal Park, is one of the largest urban parks in Asia, covering around 58 hectares. It’s famous for the Rizal Monument, which stands about 12.7 meters tall, and it marks the exact spot where Dr. José Rizal was executed on December 30, 1896.</p>
